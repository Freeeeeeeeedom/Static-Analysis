 * Represents array index pointers in PFG.
 * <p>
 * Ideally, an array index should consist of an array object and an index.
 * However, pointer analysis does not distinguish loads and stores to
 * different indexes of an array, and treats arrays as special objects
 * with a mock field. Since there is only one such mock field of each array,
 * we don't need to represent the field explicitly.
